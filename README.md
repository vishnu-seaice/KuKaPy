# KuKaPy
KuKaPy code by Vishnu Nandan with input from Rosemary Willatt and Thomas Newman. VN based this code on IDL code by Jim Mead (ProSensing).

To run, change the config files, open scatproc in spyder in and run it.

Notes:
1. This is for MOSAiC data hence the first bits of the netCDF file info (could update this)
2. This calculates NRCS values for the stare mode which may not be correct if the peak isn't the expected shape
3. This had a quick edit made on Nov 29th which hasn't been tested yet
